          <strong>

            <p>Hey there, My name is Nishant Jaryal, i am a tech geek and
                i like to know about tech devices and web desining. Now i
                am seeking to get know about the core of web developing andf
                I am always very exited to get knowledge about that how these 
                websites work.</p>


           <p>
            few years back, I saw a video on youtube that how the websites 
            are made, Then i was in 9th class, Then i made my first blogging 
            website, that website was on blogger which is a blog hosting 
            platform.
           </p>

           <p>
            
            since then i had written many blogs on different topics 
            majority of them are on smartphone reviews, for my work
            i did'nt rewarded, else i was shouted by my parents for 
            not focusing on studing, but that 2-3 months of experience
            give me a huge exposure to this field.

           </p>

           <p>
            by learning frontend web desining, side by side i have also 
            learnt many skills
           </p>
          <p>

            
            Now i am in B.tech 1st year, i have made this website by pure 
            code and without any refrence
          </p>
