        <p>Hey there, My name is Nishant Jaryal, i am a tech geek and
            i like to know about tech devices and web desining. Now i
            am seeking to get know about the core of web developing andf
            I am always very exited to get knowledge about that how these 
            websites work.</p>
<br>

       <p>
        few years back, I saw a video on youtube that how the websites 
        are made, Then i was in 9th class, Then i made my first blogging 
        website, that website was on blogger which is a blog hosting 
        platform.
       </p>

       
<br>
       <p>
        
        since then i had written many blogs on different topics 
        majority of them are on smartphone reviews, for my work
        i did'nt rewarded, else i was shouted by my parents for 
        not focusing on studing, but that 2-3 months of experience
        give me a huge exposure to this field.

       </p>
<br>
       <p>
        by learning frontend web desining, side by side i have also 
        learnt many skills
       </p>
      <p>
<br>
        
        Now i am in B.tech 1st year, i have made this website by pure 
        code and without any refrence
      </p>
